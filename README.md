# Aoe2 Civ Picker

This is supposed to pick a random AOE2 civ but baring in mind civs that you do not want to play (e.g Incas).

A list of all the AOE2 civs is in `all_civs.txt` and that is the base list of civs the python script chooses from. If you want to exclude a civ from being chosen, add it into `banned_civs.txt`.

`all_civs.txt` is correct as of the `Indian Dynasty` expansion and when the new Indian civs come out it will have to updated.

Don't know how well the script works but I ran it 450 times and I never got Incas :).
